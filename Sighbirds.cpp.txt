/*Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type.
If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.
Example - air = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3] There are two each of types 1 and 2, and one sighting of type 3. Pick the lower of the two types seen twice : type 1.
Sample Input 0
6
1 4 4 4 5 3
Sample Output 0
4
Explanation 0
The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies :
Type 1 : 1 bird
Type 2 : 0 birds
Type 3 : 1 bird
Type 4 : 3 birds
Type 5 : 1 bird
The type number that occurs at the highest frequency is type 4, so we print 4 as our answer./*/
